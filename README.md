# WORDLE

Ever heard of [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle)? No? And here I though I was living under a rock... Anyway, for some reasons, 2 years after watching [3b1b](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/wordle)'s video about it, that topic decided to crawl its way up from the depth of my memory.

I had a couple of goals this time around:
- Try to make an "efficient" solver
- Allow some room for customisation (word lenght, language, number of tries)
- Make it a WebApp that can handle multiple sessions

It's still a "work in progress" as of now... And there is a lot of room for improvement.
